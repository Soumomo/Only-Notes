## Magnetic Force

* 2 wires with current in same direction attract each other
* 2 wires with opposite current repel each other.
* This force only depends on the motion of charges not any static field.

This interaction can be described by adding a new /magnetic field/. It is defined by the following relation:
>$$\vec{F} = q \vec{E} \: + \: q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} $$

* This force is always perpendicular to the velocity.

### Possible Questions:
Why does this realtion work?
Why is magnetic force proportional to the velocity?
