[[Current Electricity]]
## Magnetic Force

* 2 wires with [[Current]] in same direction attract each other
* 2 wires with opposite current repel each other.
* This force only depends on the motion of charges not any static field.

This interaction can be described by adding a new /magnetic field/. It is defined by the following relation:
>$$\vec{F} = q \vec{E} \: + \: q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} $$

* This force is always perpendicular to the velocity.

### Possible Questions:
Why does this realtion work?
Why is magnetic force proportional to the velocity?


## Measurement of Charge in Motion

This requires a bit of thought, we use coulomb's technique of using test charges to measure our desired charge in motion. But due to special direction of force, i.e the direction of the velocity, we get varied results for the same Q. 

We decide to average out for all directions to measure Q. Imagine a large number of infinitesimal test charges Q on a sphere at rest. When the moving chrage passes through the centre of the sphere, we measure the radial components of the force. This is similar to how we measure Electric field.

Electric charge is defined by:
>$$Q=\epsilon_0$$
