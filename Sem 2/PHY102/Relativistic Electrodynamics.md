## Magnetic Force

* 2 wires with current in same direction attract each other
* 2 wires with opposite current repel each other.
* This force only depends on the motion of charges not any static field.

This interaction can be described by adding a new /magnetic field/. It is defined by the following relation:
>$$\vec{F} = q \vec{E} \: + \: q \vec{v} \times \vec{B} $$

* This force is always perpendicular to the velocity.

### Possible Questions:
Why does this realtion work?
Why is magnetic force proportional to the velocity?


## Measurement of Charge in Motion

This requires a bit of thought, we use coulomb's technique of using test charges to measure our desired charge in motion. But due to special direction of force, i.e the direction of the velocity, we get varied results for the same Q. 

We decide t
