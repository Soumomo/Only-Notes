# 1.1 Current Density

* Electric current is charge in motion. 
* Current in a wire equals to the amount of charge passing through a fixed mark on the wire in unit time.
* Charge density is a given by:
$$\vec{J}=\sum n_iq_i\vec{u_i}$$ where n is particles per $m^3$ , q is charge and u is velocity
* For electrons, we get:
$$\vec{J_e}=-eN_e\vec{u_e}$$
Note: $-eN_e$ can be expressed as charged density of electrons( $\rho_e$ )

# 1.2 Charge Conservation
* Current flowing through any surface S is just the surface integral:
$$I=\int \vec{J}.d\vec{a}$$
* If current is steady, J must be constant in time everywhere.Thus it obeys charge conservation
* The surface integral of J over all of S gives the rate of charge leaving the volume.
* If Charge keeps flowing into or out of the volume, J blows up to infinity, unless some charge is created there continously. But that can never happen.
* Therefore we conclude that,in a **truly time-independent current distribution**, surface integral of J in any closed surface is zero. Or,
$$\nabla. \vec{J}=0$$
