# 1.1 Current Density

* Electric current is charge in motion. 
* Current in a wire equals to the amount of charge passing through a fixed mark on the wire in unit time.
* Charge density is a given by:
$$\vec{J}=\sum n_iq_i\vec{u_i}$$ where n is particles per $m^3$ , q is charge and u is velocity
* For electrons, we get:
$$\vec{J_e}=-eN_e\vec{u_e}$$
Note: $-eN_e$ can be expressed as charged density of electrons($\rho_e$)
