This example consists of a capacitor system.

(1). In frame F, the electric field is of course $\vec{E}=\sigma/\epsilon_0$

(2) Let frame F' move towards the -x direction with speed v, thus

the x' dimesion is contracted, making b to $b\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}$
but we know charge is invariant so to compromise length contraction, the charge density must be **greater** in F' >

>$$\sigma'=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}$$
