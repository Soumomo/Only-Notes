## Prophase 1
1. Homologous chromosomes line up with each other
2. **Synaptonemal Complex** holds them one above another
3. Crossover of genes occurs with non-sister chromatids
4. **Chaismata** (Crossed chromatids) is formed
5. Nucleus dissolves

## Metaphase 1
Spindle fibers detach the chromosomes from each other. Independent assortment can created variation in genes here

## Anaphase & Telophase 1
Chromatids seperate and then 2 nuclei form (Haploid cells). Endoplasmic Reticulum and Golgi Apparatus divide themselves
