## Evidence That DNA Can Transform Bacteria

**Frederick Griffith** was trying to develop a vaccine against pneumonia. He was
studying *Streptococcus pneumoniae*.  He had one pathogenic (disease-causing) and one non-pathogenic (harmless). He found that when he killed the pathogenic bacteria with heat and then mixed the cell remains with living bacteria of the non-pathogenic strain, some of the living cells became pathogenic. He callled it transformation, a change in genotype and phenotype due to the assimilation of external DNA by a cell. Later work by Oswald Avery, Maclyn McCarty, and Colin MacLeod. ![[Pasted image 20230408110617.png]]



## Evidence That Viral DNA Can Program Cells

**Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase** performed experiments showing that DNA is the genetic material of a phage known as T2. Somehow, T2 could reprogram its host cell to produce viruses. But which viral component—protein or DNA—was responsible? They devised an experiment showing that only one of the two components of T2 actually enters the E. coli cell during infection.
Hershey and Chase found that the phage DNA entered the host cells but the phage protein did not. Moreover, when these bacteria were returned to a culture medium and the infection
ran its course, the E. coli released phages that contained some radioactive phosphorus. This result further showed that the DNA inside the cell played an ongoing role during the infec-
tion process. They concluded that the DNA injected by the phage must be the molecule carrying the genetic information that makes the cells produce new viral DNA and proteins. The Hershey-Chase experiment was a landmark study because it provided powerful evidence that nucleic acids, rather than proteins, are the hereditary material, at least for certain viruses.

## Structure of DNA 
These two findings became known as **Chargaff’s rules:
1. DNA base composition varies between species
2. for each species, the percentages of A and T bases are roughly equal, as are those of G and C bases. 

Among the scientists working on the problem were Linus Pauling, at the California Institute of Technology, and Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, at King’s College in London.
Francis Crick and James Watson were the first to crack the code.

In this model, the two sugar-phosphate backbones are antiparallel—that is, their subunits run in opposite directions. Watson and Crick’s model predicts that when a double helix replicates, each of the two daughter molecules will have one old strand, from the parental molecule, and one newly made strand. This semi-conservative model can be distinguished from a conservative model of replication, in which the two parental strands somehow come back together after the process. Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl devised an experiment to understand this model.


## DNA Replication

### Important Enzymes

1. **Helicase :** Untwist the double helix at the replication forks and making them available as template strands
2.  **Single-Strand Binding Proteins :** Bind to unpaired DNA strands keeping them from repairing 
3. **Topoisomerase :** Helps relieve the strain from the DNA 
4. **Primer:** Short RNA chain used to start replication. **Primase** synthesises them.
5. **DNA Polymerase :** catalyse the synthesis of new DNA by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of the new chain

### Anti-parallel Elongation

1. **Leading Strand :** The DNA starnd made by as the fork progresses 
2. **Lagging Strand :** The strand made as the replication away from the fork.
3. **Okazaki fragments :** The lagging strand is synthesized in fragments called this

**Synthesis of lagging strand is kind of complex so here's the rundown:**

1. Primase joins a primer on the lagging strand
2. DNA pol III adds nucleotides to it forming Okazaki fragment 1
3. After reaching the next primer, DNA pol III detaches 
4. Again DNA pol III creates fragment 2, 3 etc.
5. DNA pol I replaces the primer RNA with DNA
6. DNA ligase forms a bond between the fragments
7. Done!
