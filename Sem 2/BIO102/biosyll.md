Mitosis 
Prokaryotic cell division
Eukaryotic cell division
Cell cycle
Packaging of chromosome ( DNA Condensation)
Exiting the cell division
Cell cycle control
1. Internal signals (CDK, APC, Securin)
2. External signals (Density dependant, Anchorage, Contact)


Filaments in Biology
Microtubules
actin
intermediate filament
movement of microtubules
Organelles also divide in euakryotes

Meiosis
Sexual reproduction
(H+H---> D-->H)
Somatic cells vs Germ cells
Concept of alleles ( Version of a gene)
Generation of alleles
Process of meiosis 1&2 (2n--->n)
Prophase 1 ( spends 90% of time here -- crossovers happens (Chiosmata))
    Crossovers can be single, double, etc.
    Between X-X, X-Y
Synaponemal Complex
Origin of genetic variation
    Crossover
    Independent assortment of Chromosomes ( in meiosis 1)
    Random fertilization
Chromosomal non-disjunction
