A rod moves with constant velocity v in perpendicular direction to its length. There's a uniform B in z direction. 
* When there's no rod only magnetic field B exists
* A charge inside the rod feels $F=qv\times B$  

When rod is moving at constant speed and everything settles at a steady state, the force must be balanced by an equal and opposite force. This is arisen from an electric field in the rod. The magnetic force seperates the charges to the ends which creates this field.  $-F=qE$
