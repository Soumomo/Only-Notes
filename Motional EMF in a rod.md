A rod moves with constant velocity v in perpendicular direction to its length. There's a uniform B in z direction. 
* When there's no rod only magnetic field B exists
* A charge inside the rod feels $F=qv\times B$  

When rod is moving at constant speed and everything settles at a steady state, the force must be balanced
