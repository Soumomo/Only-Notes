>Question:
>What is the force that acts on a moving charge that moves in the field of another moving charge?

But first:
## Moving charge in a stationary field

First in lab frame S, we take a paticle of charge q moving in an electric field produced by a sationary charge. Using a transformation, we take a frame S' moving at a speed exactly equal to the particle, in this frame q is at rest and the field is moving. We already know how to handle this.
$$F'=qE'$$
From E we find find E' so F' is known, only problem is to transform F' to F. From relativity,
>$$\partial{t} $$
